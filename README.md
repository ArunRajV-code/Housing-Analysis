# 🏠 Housing Data Analysis Using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📄 Overview
This project performs an in-depth analysis of the housing market using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques. By evaluating key property features such as price, size, location, and condition, the project aims to uncover hidden patterns and support data-driven decision-making for buyers, sellers, and real estate stakeholders.

## 🎯 Objectives
- **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies to ensure data integrity.  
- **Price Trend Analysis**: Examine pricing patterns across various regions and property features.  
- **Feature Impact**: Identify which variables (e.g., square footage, number of bedrooms) influence price the most.  
- **Location Intelligence**: Assess how location affects property value.  
- **Actionable Insights**: Deliver useful recommendations for pricing strategies and investment planning.  

## 🔍 Key Highlights
- **Comprehensive Dataset**: Covers over 20 features per property, including structural and locational attributes.  
- **Correlation Analysis**: Understand relationships between price and other variables.  
- **Visual Insights**: Leverage charts and heatmaps for intuitive data exploration.  
- **Value Estimation**: Supports approximate pricing models based on input features.  

## 📊 Data Features
The dataset includes the following key attributes:
- **Price**: Property sale price (target variable).  
- **Sqft Living & Lot**: Interior and land area of the property.
